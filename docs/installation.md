### Inference

For **inference**, install:

```shell
pip install fast_plate_ocr
```

### Train

To **train** or use the **CLI tool**, you'll need to install:

```shell
pip install fast_plate_ocr[train]
```

???+ info
    You will probably need to **install** your desired framework for training. FastPlateOCR doesn't
    enforce you to use any specific framework. See [Keras backend](usage.md#keras-backend) section.
