## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-07

### Added

- Inference now works smoothly with different onnxruntime variants like `onnxruntime-gpu`, `onnxruntime-openvino`, etc.
- Support for building and customizing CCT (Compact Convolutional Transformer) models from YAML configs.
- New model building logic, allows users to build custom-based architectures while validating it with Pydantic.
- New metric `val_plate_len_acc`.
- Added support for categorical focal loss.
- Added more test coverage (configs, train scripts, etc.).
- New `validate_dataset.py` script to help check datasets before training.
- Export script now officially supports more formats like TFLite and CoreML.
- New plate config support: `keep_aspect_ratio`, `interpolation`, `image_color_mode` and `padding_color`.
- New default augmentation for RGB image mode.
- New default models, trained with much more data.
- Added examples and more docs.

### Changed

- Visualize augmentation script now respects config-based preprocessing.
- Improved plate config validation.
- `ONNXPlateRecognizer` is now called `LicensePlateRecognizer`.
